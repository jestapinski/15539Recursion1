ToDo:
- Add hint functionality for when the students get it wrong.  This was formerly 
  in the incorrectAns function, given how our code is structured now it should 
  be in the failureFn.  (But it can be placed in a helper and called from that 
  function.)
- Add instructions
- Add assesment
- Possibly add step, digit, etc. counter
- Make sure the list is such that there (a) won't be repeat elements and (b)
  that the number of elements in the same bucket at any iteration will be able 
  to fix on the screen.
- Save state
