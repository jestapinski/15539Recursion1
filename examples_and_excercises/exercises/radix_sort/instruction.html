<p><u><span style="font-size:16px;">The Algorithm:</span></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radix Sort is a non-comparison sorting algorithm, meaning it sorts a list without comparing the elements to one another. &nbsp;How does it do that? &nbsp;By going digit-by-digit! &nbsp;The first iteration of Radix Sort orders numbers by their ones digit. &nbsp;The second iteration orders them by their tens digit (note that the tens digit on a one-digit number is 0.) &nbsp;At any time, if there are numbers with the same i-th digit, radix sort puts them in the order that the occur in the list. &nbsp;Radix sort terminates after k iterations, where k is the number of digits in the largest number of the list.</p>

<p><u><span style="font-size:16px;">How To Use:</span></u></p>
<p>This interactive excercise involves answering questions by writing numbers in a text field, and placing elements into the appropriate buckets. &nbsp;There are three ways to place elements into the correct buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dragging the element into a bucket,</li>
<li>Clicking directly on the bucket,</li>
<li>Pressing the key corresponding to the bucket (i.e. pressing &quot;0&quot; moves the element to the 0 bucket.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that you can only move one element at a time, the enabled one (this is colored pink, whereas the rest are grey.) &nbsp;This is because the algorithm goes through the elements of the list in order, hence you have to also. &nbsp;Further note that the digit the algorithm is currently sorting by is highlighted in red, unless the number is too small to have that digit.</p>

<p>In quiz mode, there are 22 points total:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many iterations question: 2 points</li>
<li>Moving each element to the appropriate bucket: 1 point, 16 points total (0.5 points partial credit available if you place it in the wrong bucket but answer the followup question correctly.)</li>
<li>What index will this element move to question: 2 points each, 4 points total.</li>
